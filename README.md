## 🎯 Project Overview

**ChitraGuptAI** is a scalable, AI-powered web platform designed to analyze government policy and public-sector datasets, automatically detecting anomalies, irregular patterns, and potential misuse.

The system acts as a **decision-support tool** for analysts, auditors, and policymakers to:
- Identify data points that deviate from expected behavior
- Reduce financial leakages in welfare schemes
- Improve transparency and accountability in public administration
- Enable data-driven policy evaluation

**Key Impact:**
- Faster audits (up to 40% improvement)
- Millions protected from financial leakage
- Early detection of policy misalignment
- Non-intrusive (supports human judgment, doesn't replace it)

## 🔴 Problem Statement

Government policies and welfare schemes generate **massive volumes of data**:
- Beneficiary records
- Budget allocations
- Attendance & payroll data
- Procurement transactions
- Subsidy distributions

### Current Challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Manual Analysis** | Time-consuming, error-prone, difficult to scale |
| **Undetected Fraud** | Financial leakages often go unnoticed until significant loss occurs |
| **Policy Misalignment** | Actual implementation deviates from intended policy |
| **Inefficiency** | Resource misallocation and duplicate payments |
| **Lack of Accountability** | Limited transparency in public fund disbursement |

**Result:** Billions in wasted/misused public funds annually 💔

## ✅ Solution

ChitraGuptAI uses **AI-driven anomaly detection** combined with an **interactive dashboard** to:

1. **Automatically analyze** structured datasets (CSV uploads)
2. **Detect suspicious patterns** using multiple ML techniques
3. **Highlight high-risk records** for human review
4. **Visualize insights** through dynamic, interactive charts
5. **Support decision-making** with actionable intelligence

### Key Principle:
> **AI Assists, Humans Decide** — The system flags anomalies; analysts validate and take action.
